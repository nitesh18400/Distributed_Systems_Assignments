HOW TO RUN?
***********
1. Run the collector.py file at first.
2. Run the consumer.py file in a new terminal multiple times based on number of consumer needed.
3. Run the producer.py file at last and start sending messages.
4. For each message we can check the consumer terminal to see who has recieved it.
5. For every 5 messages we can see the summary and contributions in collector window. This 5 is a variable can be changed.
